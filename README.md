WebEvent
========

## Generic companion app for small events

For participants:
- Install & launch the app
- Scan the QR code provided by the organizers
- Enjoy

For organizers:
- Write a simple web application for your event
- Generate a QR code with either a generic url or a per-participant url
- You can use "fallback url#webapp url" to send users without the app to the fallback url, e.g. the app install page
- Once the app is provisioned by scanning the QR code, future app launches will go directly to the saved url
- You'll need to clear the app data (or uninstall & reinstall) to change the url
- This app is open source, feel free to whitelabel it by changing the name & icon (just be sure to give credit)
